# Diamond-Price-Prediction
A web application that predicts the price of a diamond based on its attributes. I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to design the front-end and Python and Flask to implement the back-end. I used the Diamonds dataset from Kaggle .The main objective of this project was to demonstrate my skills in web development, data analysis, and machine learning.
